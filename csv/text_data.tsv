STRATEGY  

19 September 2019  

1 (4)  

STYR 2017/1345  

Lund University’s strategy for sustainable development 2019–2026  
Approved by the vice-chancellor 19 September 2019  

Lund University is to understand, explain and improve our world and the human
condition  
and by doing so act as a driving force for sustainable development. The
University works ac-  
tively to integrate an overall approach to sustainable development in all its
activities: educa-  
tion, research, external engagement and organisational development.  

1\. Background  

In a sustainable world, people’s needs are met without compromising future
generations’ possibili-  
ties to meet their needs. This requires that society addresses a number of
major challenges so that  
economic development is within the framework for social and environmental
sustainability, and the  
Earth’s resources are not depleted. Such a global vision for sustainable
development is expressed in  
the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals from 2015. The UN’s Agenda 2030
states how these  
goals are to be achieved. The sustainable development goals form an integrated
and indivisible  
whole in which the different goals address all dimensions of sustainability:
economic, social and en-  
vironmental. As the goals by their very nature are linked, there is a need for
solutions that create syn-  
ergies and lead development forwards, while there is also a need for knowledge
on how to identify  
and manage goal conflicts.  

The issues relating to sustainable development are not new, but have become
increasingly topical  
due to the fact that the striving for social sustainability with basic human
rights such as the right to  
a satisfactory standard of living, health, work and education and gender
equality for present and fu-  
ture generations is being made more difficult by ongoing climate change,
overexploitation of the  
Earth’s resources, depletion of biodiversity, other environmental pollution
and conflicts. In many  
cases there is little time to identify and implement solutions to meet these
challenges, as delays in  
working towards sustainable development successively lead to a desirable
future being increasingly  
difficult to realise. Meeting these challenges requires knowledge about how
sustainable develop-  
ment can be achieved and how knowledge can be converted into action. This is
supported by  
knowledge from many different areas that are also integrated into a holistic
perspective.  

Lund University’s strategy for sustainable development complements the
University’s strategic plan  
and observes the Higher Education Act1. The strategy covers the University’s
entire organisation and  
all employees. Implementation of the strategy is to be carried out in harmony
with other relevant  

1 The requirement for Sweden’s higher education institutions to promote all
dimensions of sustainable  

development is stated in the Higher Education Act (1992:1434 Chapter 1,
Section 5).

strategies, policy documents, the policy for sustainable development,
regulations and statements,  
and be adapted to the affected organisations’ conditions, opportunities and
needs. The aim of the  
strategy is consequently to provide a direction and establish a number of
visions, not to regulate  
how the implementation is to be carried out. The visions concern management
and further develop-  
ment of ongoing activities, as well as new aspects of activities.  

With its comprehensive range of disciplines, Lund University can follow the
holistic approach of  
Agenda 2030 by creating and conveying knowledge with a scientific and artistic
basis.  

2\. Visions for sustainable development  

Sustainable development is a basic condition that affects the University’s
education, research, exter-  
nal engagement and organisational development. Education equips undergraduate
and postgraduate  
students to meet challenges and promote subject-relevant perspectives on
sustainable development.  
Curiosity-driven research plays a crucial role by contributing to the
understanding of our world and  
thereby to preparatory knowledge for already recognised or currently unknown
future challenges. The  
breadth of the University is utilised to create cross-boundary and
interdisciplinary research and edu-  
cation focusing on identified needs for knowledge and sustainable solutions.
Sustainable development  
is promoted in society by making research visible and participating in
processes where scientific  
knowledge informs decisions and supports new solutions. The University
utilises opportunities to  
strengthen all parts of the organisation and activities by practising what it
preaches and proactively  
working to develop in relation to the global sustainable development goals.
The strategy is used and  
applied in all activities at the University, but how this is done varies
between programmes, fields of  
research and other areas of activity depending on their content and form.  

2.1 Overall visions  

 Lund University integrates sustainable development in its education,
research, external engage-  
ment and organisational development, and the University’s employees are well
aware of their  
roles in this work.  

 Lund University is involved in local, regional, national and global social
arenas2 in order for  
scientific knowledge to provide leverage in society’s striving for
sustainability, in both the  
short and long term.  

 Lund University is a prominent voice in the field of sustainability within
research and  

teaching as well as in public debate and cultural life.  

 Lund University communicates its sustainability-related work within the
organisation and to  
wider society in ways that make it easy to both reach out and gain access to
its activities.  

2.2  

Education and student participation  

A basic understanding and knowledge of sustainability is included in
programmes in all cycles and  
within all subjects. This contributes to continuous reflection on the relation
between education and  
sustainable development so that sustainability aspects are integrated in the
students’ future profes-  
sional roles. As a part of a functioning student influence, students also
participate in the work of in-  
tegrating sustainable development in Lund University’s activities.  

Visions for education and student participation:  

2 Arenas and initiatives are used as an overall collective term that may refer
to long-term or fixed-term development work,  
virtual or physical forums, external engagement activities, etc. Different
types of initiative may be relevant for different  
parts of the University.  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Page 3

3 (4)  

 All students acquire knowledge and understanding of sustainable development
and how their  
programmes relate to this, and thereby contribute expertise in their future
roles in society.  

 There is continuing professional development within sustainable development
for all  

employees at Lund University.  

 The University supports student initiatives in sustainable development and
there are op-  
portunities for students to participate in work to achieve the goals of the
strategy.  

2.3 Research  

Lund University’s research develops relevant scientific knowledge that
increases understanding of  
problems related to sustainable development, the possible solutions that exist
and the potential unde-  
sirable effects of solutions that can arise. As sustainability-related
problems are complex and the so-  
lution to a problem can sometimes cause another, Lund University also develops
research that in-  
crease understanding of such connections. An important component in the
University’s research is to  
use scientific facts and a broad approach to critically review society’s
problem monitoring and deci-  
sions in the area of sustainability. The University’s research is both
critical and solution-oriented and  
generates knowledge that contributes to new perspectives on sustainable
development. Both curios-  
ity-driven and needs-based research form the starting point and inspiration
for interdisciplinary and  
cross-boundary research that is responsive to society’s knowledge needs
concerning sustainable de-  
velopment.  

Visions for research:  

 Research of the highest quality creates the basic knowledge about, and
innovative solu-  

tions to, sustainability-related problems.  

 The University’s researchers are well aware of the relevance of their own
research to sustain-  
able development and how their research relates to other fields of research
concerning sus-  
tainable development.  

 Forms of interdisciplinary and cross-boundary research on sustainable
development are well  
developed, which among other things entails dedicated initiatives2 that bring
together re-  
search at various faculties.  

 Strategic external engagement with a broad spectrum of collaborating parties
helps to  
identify research needs for sustainable development and to produce knowledge
that  
meets these needs.  

2.4  

External engagement  

Lund University is involved in strong external engagement regarding
sustainable development issues  
with an aim to identify areas in need of research and education. This external
engagement contributes  
to research being used to support decisions and for critical analysis of
issues relating to sustainable  
development. This is achieved by employees taking part in relevant local,
regional, national and  
global arenas and there engaging in discussions with a broad spectrum of
organisations in society3,  
making available new knowledge that can support decisions, collaborating on
the development of  
solutions that create sustainable development, and identifying new research
and education needs.  

Visions for external engagement:  

 Lund University generates knowledge that is relevant for sustainable
development in collaboration  

3 E.g. other higher education institutions, public authorities, the business
sector, civil society and citizens.  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Page 4

4 (4)  

with organisations in society, but also contributes by critically reviewing
society’s ef-  
forts regarding sustainable development.  

 Researchers at Lund University play a prominent part in sustainability-
related local, re-  

gional, national and global arenas by compiling knowledge, drawing up research
agendas,  
and as experts.  

 Dynamic and integrating arenas for external engagement with public
authorities, the busi-  
ness sector and civil society are used to jointly contribute to sustainable
development.  
 Lund University provides resources for academic capacity development in
developing  

countries through partnerships and student and teaching staff exchanges.  

2.5  

A sustainable organisation  

Lund University’s operations strive to constantly improve their sustainability
management and  
show in concrete terms that sustainable development works in practice. The
work and study envi-  
ronment is inclusive, enriching, stimulating, safe and secure. The
international environment that  
characterises Lund University contributes to promoting, spreading and
deepening a positive under-  
standing of other cultures, ideologies and frames of reference for human
behaviour.  

Visions for the organisation:  

 Lund University maintains a good, safe, secure and accessible work
environment in all respects.  
 Lund University is a resource-efficient organisation, with a minimised
climate and environmental  

impact.  

 Activities at Lund University are based on gender equality, equal
opportunities and diversity  

and use the strengths that this entails.  

 Lund University works for the integration of new arrivals in Sweden and
their entry into  

working life, including academics.  

3\. Implementation and follow up  

The strategy for sustainable development affects, and sets requirements for,
all parts of Lund Univer-  
sity. Faculties and other organisations within the University develop their
specific strategies as well  
as plan and run their operations based on the strategy for sustainable
development. Faculties and  
equivalent organisations draw up their own action plans that outline division
of responsibilities, roles  
and resources in order to realise the visions in the strategy as well as how
these plans are to be fol-  
lowed up, evaluated and, if required, revised. As the focus, conditions and
organisation of work on  
sustainable development management varies between the University’s different
units, these deter-  
mine how the work to achieve Lund University’s shared vision and goals is to
be conducted and fol-  
lowed up. Overall reporting, with associated evaluations of how the strategy
is being implemented, is  
carried out annually within the framework of the annual report processes at
faculty level and for  
Lund University as a whole.  

 Managers and management groups at all levels are responsible for considering
matters  

relating to sustainable development in decision, implementation and follow up
processes.  

 All employees are responsible for their work contributing to the realisation
of the strategy’s inten-  

tions.

STYR 2017/1345  

Lund University’s strategy for sustainable development 2019–2026  
Approved by the vice-chancellor 19 September 2019  

Lund University is to understand, explain and improve our world and the human
condition  
and by doing so act as a driving force for sustainable development. The
University works ac-  
tively to integrate an overall approach to sustainable development in all its
activities: educa-  
tion, research, external engagement and organisational development.  

1\. Background  

In a sustainable world, people’s needs are met without compromising future
generations’ possibili-  
ties to meet their needs. This requires that society addresses a number of
major challenges so that  
economic development is within the framework for social and environmental
sustainability, and the  
Earth’s resources are not depleted. Such a global vision for sustainable
development is expressed in  
the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals from 2015. The UN’s Agenda 2030
states how these  
goals are to be achieved. The sustainable development goals form an integrated
and indivisible  
whole in which the different goals address all dimensions of sustainability:
economic, social and en-  
vironmental. As the goals by their very nature are linked, there is a need for
solutions that create syn-  
ergies and lead development forwards, while there is also a need for knowledge
on how to identify  
and manage goal conflicts.  

The issues relating to sustainable development are not new, but have become
increasingly topical  
due to the fact that the striving for social sustainability with basic human
rights such as the right to  
a satisfactory standard of living, health, work and education and gender
equality for present and fu-  
ture generations is being made more difficult by ongoing climate change,
overexploitation of the  
Earth’s resources, depletion of biodiversity, other environmental pollution
and conflicts. In many  
cases there is little time to identify and implement solutions to meet these
challenges, as delays in  
working towards sustainable development successively lead to a desirable
future being increasingly  
difficult to realise. Meeting these challenges requires knowledge about how
sustainable develop-  
ment can be achieved and how knowledge can be converted into action. This is
supported by  
knowledge from many different areas that are also integrated into a holistic
perspective.  

Lund University’s strategy for sustainable development complements the
University’s strategic plan  
and observes the Higher Education Act1. The strategy covers the University’s
entire organisation and  
all employees. Implementation of the strategy is to be carried out in harmony
with other relevant  

1 The requirement for Sweden’s higher education institutions to promote all
dimensions of sustainable  

development is stated in the Higher Education Act (1992:1434 Chapter 1,
Section 5).

strategies, policy documents, the policy for sustainable development,
regulations and statements,  
and be adapted to the affected organisations’ conditions, opportunities and
needs. The aim of the  
strategy is consequently to provide a direction and establish a number of
visions, not to regulate  
how the implementation is to be carried out. The visions concern management
and further develop-  
ment of ongoing activities, as well as new aspects of activities.  

With its comprehensive range of disciplines, Lund University can follow the
holistic approach of  
Agenda 2030 by creating and conveying knowledge with a scientific and artistic
basis.  

2\. Visions for sustainable development  

Sustainable development is a basic condition that affects the University’s
education, research, exter-  
nal engagement and organisational development. Education equips undergraduate
and postgraduate  
students to meet challenges and promote subject-relevant perspectives on
sustainable development.  
Curiosity-driven research plays a crucial role by contributing to the
understanding of our world and  
thereby to preparatory knowledge for already recognised or currently unknown
future challenges. The  
breadth of the University is utilised to create cross-boundary and
interdisciplinary research and edu-  
cation focusing on identified needs for knowledge and sustainable solutions.
Sustainable development  
is promoted in society by making research visible and participating in
processes where scientific  
knowledge informs decisions and supports new solutions. The University
utilises opportunities to  
strengthen all parts of the organisation and activities by practising what it
preaches and proactively  
working to develop in relation to the global sustainable development goals.
The strategy is used and  
applied in all activities at the University, but how this is done varies
between programmes, fields of  
research and other areas of activity depending on their content and form.  

2.1 Overall visions  

 Lund University integrates sustainable development in its education,
research, external engage-  
ment and organisational development, and the University’s employees are well
aware of their  
roles in this work.  

 Lund University is involved in local, regional, national and global social
arenas2 in order for  
scientific knowledge to provide leverage in society’s striving for
sustainability, in both the  
short and long term.  

 Lund University is a prominent voice in the field of sustainability within
research and  

teaching as well as in public debate and cultural life.  

 Lund University communicates its sustainability-related work within the
organisation and to  
wider society in ways that make it easy to both reach out and gain access to
its activities.  

2.2  

Education and student participation  

A basic understanding and knowledge of sustainability is included in
programmes in all cycles and  
within all subjects. This contributes to continuous reflection on the relation
between education and  
sustainable development so that sustainability aspects are integrated in the
students’ future profes-  
sional roles. As a part of a functioning student influence, students also
participate in the work of in-  
tegrating sustainable development in Lund University’s activities.  

Visions for education and student participation:  

2 Arenas and initiatives are used as an overall collective term that may refer
to long-term or fixed-term development work,  
virtual or physical forums, external engagement activities, etc. Different
types of initiative may be relevant for different  
parts of the University.

3 (4)  

 All students acquire knowledge and understanding of sustainable development
and how their  
programmes relate to this, and thereby contribute expertise in their future
roles in society.  

 There is continuing professional development within sustainable development
for all  

employees at Lund University.  

 The University supports student initiatives in sustainable development and
there are op-  
portunities for students to participate in work to achieve the goals of the
strategy.  

2.3 Research  

Lund University’s research develops relevant scientific knowledge that
increases understanding of  
problems related to sustainable development, the possible solutions that exist
and the potential unde-  
sirable effects of solutions that can arise. As sustainability-related
problems are complex and the so-  
lution to a problem can sometimes cause another, Lund University also develops
research that in-  
crease understanding of such connections. An important component in the
University’s research is to  
use scientific facts and a broad approach to critically review society’s
problem monitoring and deci-  
sions in the area of sustainability. The University’s research is both
critical and solution-oriented and  
generates knowledge that contributes to new perspectives on sustainable
development. Both curios-  
ity-driven and needs-based research form the starting point and inspiration
for interdisciplinary and  
cross-boundary research that is responsive to society’s knowledge needs
concerning sustainable de-  
velopment.  

Visions for research:  

 Research of the highest quality creates the basic knowledge about, and
innovative solu-  

tions to, sustainability-related problems.  

 The University’s researchers are well aware of the relevance of their own
research to sustain-  
able development and how their research relates to other fields of research
concerning sus-  
tainable development.  

 Forms of interdisciplinary and cross-boundary research on sustainable
development are well  
developed, which among other things entails dedicated initiatives2 that bring
together re-  
search at various faculties.  

 Strategic external engagement with a broad spectrum of collaborating parties
helps to  
identify research needs for sustainable development and to produce knowledge
that  
meets these needs.  

2.4  

External engagement  

Lund University is involved in strong external engagement regarding
sustainable development issues  
with an aim to identify areas in need of research and education. This external
engagement contributes  
to research being used to support decisions and for critical analysis of
issues relating to sustainable  
development. This is achieved by employees taking part in relevant local,
regional, national and  
global arenas and there engaging in discussions with a broad spectrum of
organisations in society3,  
making available new knowledge that can support decisions, collaborating on
the development of  
solutions that create sustainable development, and identifying new research
and education needs.  

Visions for external engagement:  

 Lund University generates knowledge that is relevant for sustainable
development in collaboration  

3 E.g. other higher education institutions, public authorities, the business
sector, civil society and citizens.

with organisations in society, but also contributes by critically reviewing
society’s ef-  
forts regarding sustainable development.  

 Researchers at Lund University play a prominent part in sustainability-
related local, re-  

gional, national and global arenas by compiling knowledge, drawing up research
agendas,  
and as experts.  

 Dynamic and integrating arenas for external engagement with public
authorities, the busi-  
ness sector and civil society are used to jointly contribute to sustainable
development.  
 Lund University provides resources for academic capacity development in
developing  

countries through partnerships and student and teaching staff exchanges.  

2.5  

A sustainable organisation  

Lund University’s operations strive to constantly improve their sustainability
management and  
show in concrete terms that sustainable development works in practice. The
work and study envi-  
ronment is inclusive, enriching, stimulating, safe and secure. The
international environment that  
characterises Lund University contributes to promoting, spreading and
deepening a positive under-  
standing of other cultures, ideologies and frames of reference for human
behaviour.  

Visions for the organisation:  

 Lund University maintains a good, safe, secure and accessible work
environment in all respects.  
 Lund University is a resource-efficient organisation, with a minimised
climate and environmental  

impact.  

 Activities at Lund University are based on gender equality, equal
opportunities and diversity  

and use the strengths that this entails.  

 Lund University works for the integration of new arrivals in Sweden and
their entry into  

working life, including academics.  

3\. Implementation and follow up  

The strategy for sustainable development affects, and sets requirements for,
all parts of Lund Univer-  
sity. Faculties and other organisations within the University develop their
specific strategies as well  
as plan and run their operations based on the strategy for sustainable
development. Faculties and  
equivalent organisations draw up their own action plans that outline division
of responsibilities, roles  
and resources in order to realise the visions in the strategy as well as how
these plans are to be fol-  
lowed up, evaluated and, if required, revised. As the focus, conditions and
organisation of work on  
sustainable development management varies between the University’s different
units, these deter-  
mine how the work to achieve Lund University’s shared vision and goals is to
be conducted and fol-  
lowed up. Overall reporting, with associated evaluations of how the strategy
is being implemented, is  
carried out annually within the framework of the annual report processes at
faculty level and for  
Lund University as a whole.  

 Managers and management groups at all levels are responsible for considering
matters  

relating to sustainable development in decision, implementation and follow up
processes.  

 All employees are responsible for their work contributing to the realisation
of the strategy’s inten-  

tions.
